# Loss-Prediction
Financial fraud or bank fraud is the use of illegal or illicit means to obtain money, assets, or other
property owned or held by a financial institution, or to obtain money from depositors. There is a
wide variety of financial and bank fraud where predictive analytic is widely used such as on-line
banking, internet credit card payment and rogue trading.
A loan application form seeks a lot of information about the applicant. Such data can be used to
predict which customers are most likely to turn up as fraudulent. The customers who have been
predicted to have a high probability to default are then declined the loan. The goal is to use
historical data to build a model that could help the bank officer to decide whether or not to
approve a loan request based on the information submitted by the applicant.
When a bank receives a loan application, based on the applicant’s profile the bank has to make a
decision regarding whether to go ahead with the loan approval or not. Two types of risks are
associated with the approver’s decision:
* If the applicant will indeed repay the loan, then not approving the loan to the person
results in a loss of business to the bank related to the interest rate received by the bank
* If the applicant is not going to repay the debt, then approving the loan to the person
results in a financial loss to the bank equivalent to the unpaid debt and the additional
expenses the bank may incur.

*The goal is to minimize loss from the bank’s perspective using a decision engine regarding
who to grant approval of the loan and who to reject.*

The code is attached to clean, preprocess, train and test the data using both decision tree and random forest.
